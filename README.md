SITE README
===========

OVERVIEW
--------

This site was built using Gatsby with a Wordpress backend. For more info on using Gatsby with headless CMS, check out this great tutorial [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/23/migrate-your-wordpress-site-to-the-jamstack/).

ATTENTION
---------

The contact form submission uses the EmailJS API. For it to work, you need a private API key (GATSBY_EMAIL_USER) and a template key (GATSBY_EMAIL_TEMPLATE). For more info on how to generate these keys, visit the [EmailJS Docs](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)
